# The Test of Arithemtic Coding & Huffman Coding

## Introduction

This is a test program for two coding way(Arithemtic Coding & Huffman Coding). First, this program will execute Arithemtic encoding and decording, and then show the time consumption respectively. Second, this program will execute Huffman encoding and decording, and then show the time consumption respectively.

This program will encode each line of an English file and save it as a file, and then decode the file after encoding.

## Operation

```
make && ./obj/main.o
```
